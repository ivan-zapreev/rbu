# Software Quality

## Motivating Examples: Major

* `1985`--`1987` -- *Therac-25:*
    * Radiation therapy overdose
    * Control software flaw:
        * Race conditions
    * Death of `6` (six) cancer patients
* `1996`  -- *Ariane-5 missile:*
    * Missile crash
    * Control software flaw:
        * `64`-bit float to `16`-bit int
    * $`7` billion development program
    * $`500` million cargo
* `2005` -- *Toyota Camry:*
    * Sudden unintended acceleration:
    * Control software flaw:
        * Recursion causing stack overflow
    * `89` deaths and `57` injuries
    * $`1.2` billion compensations

## Software Development: V-model

![Software development process](./images/v_model.png){height=70%}

## Software Development: V & V
Is formally defined in, e.g.: [`ISO-9000:2015`](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9000:ed-4:v1:en:term:3.8.12):

* **Verification** -- *"Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that specified requirements have been fulfilled."*
* **Validation** -- *"Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled."*

## Software Development: Testing

* **Verification**:
    * Are we building the product right?
    * Does the system comply with its specification?
* **Validation**:
    * Are we building the right product?
    * Does the system meet the needs of the customer?

## Formal Verification

**Facts:**

* No glabally recognized definition of Formal Methods[^1].
* Local attempts to have one[^2], e.g.:

> Formal methods are techniques used to model complex systems as mathematical entities. 

>By building a rigorous model of a complex system, it is possible to verify the system's properties in a more thorough fashion than *empirical testing*.

[^2]: ["Formal Methods", Michael Collins, CMU](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/des_s99/formal_methods/)

**Conclusion:**

Formal methods are techniques suitable for Verification.

## Formal Software Verification

A program shall satisfy a formal specification of its behavior.

# Programming Languages

## Language generations

![Generations of Programming languages](./images/languages.png){height=70%}
  
## Imperative programming: Main

* *Imperative* -- Describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state. Imperative JavaScript example:
```{js, eval=F}
        function sum(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        }
        console.log( sum(5, 3) );
```
* *Declarative* -- Expresses what to accomplish without specifying concrete steps. Declarative JavaScript example:
```{js, eval=F}
        const sum = a => b => a + b;
        console.log( sum (5) (3) );
```

*Procedural language* -- is an imperative language in which the program is built from one or more subroutines. 

## Imperative programming: Test

![If you laugh, it means you've passed](./images/imp-decl-joke.png){height=110%}

## ANSI-C
An *imperatice* *procedral* language.
  
# Scientific Approache

## Overview

## Formal Methods

## Hoare/Dijkstra approach
  
# Frama - C
  
## General info

A plugin-based open-source cross-platform framework for `C` source-code analysis:

* Browsing unfamiliar code
* Static code analysis
* Dynamic code analysis
* Code transformations
* Certification of critical software

You can easily build upon the existing plug-ins to implement your own analysis.
