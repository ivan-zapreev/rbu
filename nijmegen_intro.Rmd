# Teaching Approach

## Teaching Approach: Classification

![Teaching Approaches](./images/teaching.jpg){height=70%}

## Teaching Approach: Literature

An extensive study is presented **in literature**[^6]:

* The ideas should follow logically
* The structure of ideas should be created in class
* Create a comfortable environment
* Use theories like: Social Learning, Constructivism, etc

**Learning can differ greatly** from person to person:

* `5`  different teaching paradigms
* `32` different teaching models between them.

*"The best and maybe the only possible outcome is to try to **determine what** methods or combination of methods a teacher should apply to **suit the biggest percentage in a class**."*

[^6]: "Choosing learning methods suitable for teaching and learning in computer science", Estelle Taylore et al., IADIS, 2013

## Teaching Approach: Me[^7]

**Connect:**

* Be personal
* Use Humor
* Be assertive

**Motivate:**

* Create interest
* Challenge
* Track engagement

**Guide:**

* Define Structure
* Help if needed
* Keep challenging
