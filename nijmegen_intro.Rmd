# Teaching approach

## Teaching approach: Classification

![Teaching approaches](./images/teaching.jpg){height=70%}

## Teaching approach: Literature

An extensive study is presented in literature[^6]:

* The ideas should follow logically
* The structure of ideas should be created in class
* Create a comfortable environment
* Use theories like: Social Learning, Constructivism, etc

Learning can differ greatly from person to person:

* `5`  different teaching paradigms
* `32` different teaching models between them.

*"The best and maybe the only possible outcome is to try to determine what methods or combination of methods a teacher should apply to suit the biggest percentage in a class."*

[^6]: "Choosing learning methods suitable for teaching and learning in computer science", Estelle Taylore et al., IADIS, 2013

## Teaching approach: Mine[^7]

**Connect:**

* Be personal
* Use Humor
* Be assertive

**Motivate:**

* Create interest
* Challenge
* Track engagement

**Guide:**

* Define Structure
* Help if needed
* Keep challenging
